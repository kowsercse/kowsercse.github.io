Recently I have read two interesting article related to people management in an organization.
* [Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Principle)
* [Dilbert Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_Principle)

# Peter Principle

Introduced by [Laurence J. Peter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_J._Peter) and [Raymond Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Hull) in 1969. They said that, Employees tend to be promoted until they reach a position at which they cannot work competently.

## What does it mean to you
You will be rewarded your promotion as long as you can handle your responsibility. Now say, you reached your maximum limit (level of incompetence), and no longer meet the demand. Which means you will be just removed. So keep your eyes opened, make your brain working and clear your desk. Otherwise, be ready to face the ugly truth.
On the other hand if you see someone excelled at their current job position, they are often rewarded a promotion meaning he can do something better with his skill. So keep faith in you.

# Dilbert Principle
It is somewhat opposite to Peter Principle. Observation by [Dilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert) cartoonist [Scott Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams) stating that, companies tend to systematically promote their least-competent employees to management (generally middle management), in order to limit the amount of damage they are capable of doing.

## What does it mean to you?
Scott Adams explained it for you already!
> I wrote The Dilbert Principle around the concept that in many cases the least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they’re the ones you don’t want doing actual work. You want them ordering the doughnuts and yelling at people for not doing their assignments—you know, the easy work. Your heart surgeons and your computer programmers—your smart people—aren’t in management. That principle was literally happening everywhere.

So we should say that, these issues combined causes uncertainty among an employee. Thus, it leads him to think about second option.
