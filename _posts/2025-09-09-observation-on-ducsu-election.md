So, yesterday Dhaka University held its DUCSU election. Never forget, its students are the future leaders of Bangladesh.

# Evaluation

* Surprised to see the landslide victory by Shibir
* BGCS failed to encash the july revolution
  * What is waiting for them on upcoming national election
* BJCL & BGCS got rejected
* Same for leftist including BSU
* Same old politics and attitude specially from BJCL
* DUCSU election got most attention for last couple of weeks
  * Covered by all news source
  * Include social media
  * Even I am writing about it
* This attention is well deserved
  * Nothing to show for on recent times
  * It needs not to be like this, but here we are

# Expectations

* Get rid of guest room (গণরুম) culture
* Stop tender rigging (টেন্ডারবাজি)

# Summary

* Student politics should be allowed
* Impossible to stop student politics
* Problem is our student politics
  * They mostly functions as muscle man for political parties
  * We need to find out the solution to solve it
* Never forget those glorious moments
  * Memory of Aug 5 is still fresh
* We need to accept the reality of this result
* What is next?
